# Idea
### Online store
- My app will be an online store where users will have the ability to post items that they want to sell. They can also look at items other people have posted on the site and purchase those items.

# MVP
- Users create an account, their information will be stored in the database.
- Users can add/delete the items they wish to sell, these items will be stored in the database.
- Users can look at a list of items others have added to the site to sell.
- Then the users can add these items to their cart to purchase.
- Users can look at their cart to view what they have added and remove items from cart, if they wish to do so.
